## Workspace_Import-Export-Tool ##

The Workspace Import/Export Tool add-on allows users to manage multiple workspaces for a single system definition file.  This functionality is commonly used for managing high-channel systems where users want to reuse one of more workspaces without recreating them from scratch everytime.
This tool, together with aliases, allows user to create workspaces once and reuse them over multiple systems or on the same system with different test conditions (e.g managing subsets of channels located in different screens).
